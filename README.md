# DATABASE-BACKUP-AND-RECOVERY--TASK-4
This task demonstrated how to back up and restore databases in MySQL and PostgreSQL. The key steps involved using utility commands (mysqldump, pg_dump, and pg_restore) to back up the database and restore it in case of failure. Additionally, we provided bash scripts to automate both the backup and recovery processes.
